*Quantity Always Trumps Quality*

This blog post offers a piece of advice: practice, practice, practice. It posits that the act of *writing* code will always increase your skill in it, and that you won't improve if you don't practice. 

*Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Crafstmanship*

> There are two parts to learning craftsmanship: knowledge and work. You must gain
the knowledge of principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics that a craftsman knows, and
you must also grind that knowledge into your fingers, eyes, and gut by working hard and
practicing.

I was more or less on the author's side until this section: "We are deeply complicit in the planning of the project and share a great deal of the responsibility for any failures; especially if those failures have to do with bad code!"

I resent the individualist narrative that engineers should feel bad for choices they make in how to interact with their company's codebase, and I doubly resent the implicit judgment in this section. What the author seems to be proposing is that each individual should step up, work harder, and resist the pressure of culture. It is also completely ignorant to some of the things I've seen in these spaces: bosses who truly do care about the short-sighted quantity over quality dilemma, quotas or deadlines that encourage you to speed up and move on to the next ticket, or even the simple fact that you're working for a *company's existing codebase* and often not on a project that you have any passion for. 

But sure, if it strokes your ego, judge your peers for their spaghetti code and snuggle up to your managers instead. 

To be clear, I also do have a lot of care for clean code, and I think this chapter makes some compelling arguments about how much time and effort it takes to be able to develop this sense. It involves a lot of understanding, a lot of experience, and a lot of practice, and I have a lot of respect for that.
